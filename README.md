# <Personal Portfolio>

## Description

This project will be the baseline of my development in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am planning on creating a Personal Portfolio page that I will be constantly expanding on with the knowledge gained on my new journey as a web-developer. By creating a Personal Portfolio, I will be able to keep tabs on my published work, and by the end of my Bootcamp, I will have a fully functional Portfolio to show off to potential employeers.

So far, I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. My goal is to further develop this page in the future using Javascript and potentially other languages/tools that I pick up on my journey.

## Installation

No installation required. This is a HTML based project containing HTML, CSS and in the future, Javascript files which will run in any browser.

## Usage

Not Applicable.
